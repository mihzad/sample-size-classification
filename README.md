The study showed that the method of forming the training sample significantly affects both the average quality of the model and the stability of the results. Stratified sampling provides the lowest variance and allows achieving high F1 values ​​with smaller data volumes. Simple random and systematic methods demonstrate similar, but less stable results. Bernoulli selection is the least stable due to the additional randomness of the subsample size.

Among the models, the best resistance to downsampling of the Palmer Penguins dataset was shown by logistic regression, which indicates a clear separation of the dataset. The Random Forest model demonstrated stable, but more gradual growth dynamics. KNN turned out to be the most sensitive to the size of the training set.
Thus, for the penguin classification problem, achieving F1 ≥ 0.90 is possible even when using subsamples of a much smaller size than the full dataset, provided that stratified sampling and a sufficiently powerful model are used.

The obtained results and developments with minor edits can be applied to other datasets and, accordingly, have practical significance for assessing the minimum sufficient amount of data in applied machine learning problems.
